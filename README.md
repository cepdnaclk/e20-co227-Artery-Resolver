# Software to analyse FMD of arteries 
___


## Overview
A software to aid analysis of flow mediated dialation of arteries.

Artery Resolver is a software for the estimation of early markers of cardiovascular risk. In 

particular, the software is composed of two main modules of measurement: 

1. Average diameter calculation 

2. Average flow velocity calculation 

The device is based on an algorithm that identifies the edges of the arterial vessel by 

analyzing ultrasound scanning video by breaking it into sequences of ultrasound images 

frames. We have used a machine learning model to enhance the diameter calculation part 

and an openCV model to calculate flow velocity. 

The software must be used by trained and qualified personnel, such as laboratory 

technicians, nurses, physicians and / or sonographers
